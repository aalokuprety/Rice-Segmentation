# Fast Photography Protocol for 100 Genotypes

## ⚡ TIME-SAVING STRATEGIES

### Problem
Manually separating seeds so they don't touch = **WAY TOO SLOW!**
- 100 genotypes × 3 photos × 2 minutes separation = **6+ hours** 😫

### Solution
Use **automated separation** with watershed algorithm = **FAST!**
- 100 genotypes × 3 photos × 30 seconds = **1.5 hours** 🎉

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Natural Scatter Method

### Photography Setup (30 seconds per photo!)

**Materials:**
- White paper or poster board (background)
- Small cup or scoop
- Phone/camera on tripod or steady surface
- Good overhead lighting

**Steps per genotype:**
1. **Pour** 50-100 seeds onto white paper
2. **Gently shake/tilt** paper to spread them somewhat
3. **Take photo** - Done! Don't worry about touching seeds!
4. Repeat 2 more times (rearrange between photos)

**Time:** 100 genotypes × 3 photos × 30 sec = **1.5 hours total!** ✅

### Key Points:
- ✅ **Seeds CAN touch** - watershed algorithm separates them
- ✅ **Use MORE seeds** (50-100 per photo) - better statistics
- ✅ **Overlapping OK** - algorithm handles it
- ✅ **Natural distribution** - more realistic

## 🔧 Technical: How Watershed Works

**Watershed Algorithm** automatically separates touching objects:

1. **Distance Transform:** Measures distance from background
   - Creates "peaks" at seed centers
   - Creates "valleys" at boundaries

2. **Peak Detection:** Finds center of each seed
   - Even when seeds touch!

3. **Flooding:** Grows regions from peaks
   - Stops at boundaries between seeds
   - Creates separation line

**Visual:**
```
Touching seeds:  ○○  →  Watershed sees:  ∧∧  →  Separated:  ○|○
                                         ││
                                      (peaks)
```

## 🚀 UPDATED WORKFLOW

### Option A: Natural Scatter (FASTEST!) ⚡

**Total Time: ~2 hours**

```powershell
# Step 1: Photograph (1.5 hours)
# - Pour 50-100 seeds per photo
# - Gently spread (don't perfectly separate)
# - Take 3 photos per genotype
# - Seeds can touch!

# Step 2: Process with watershed (30 min)
cd "c:\Fall 2025\ABE Work\Rice segmentation"
python scripts/genotype_screening_watershed.py --input data/raw --min-distance 15 --sensitivity 0.5
```

### Option B: Single Photo per Genotype (SIMPLEST!)

**Total Time: ~1.5 hours**

```powershell
# Step 1: Photograph (1 hour)
# - Pour 80-100 seeds per photo
# - ONE photo per genotype = 100 photos total
# - Natural scatter, touching OK

# Step 2: Process (30 min)
python scripts/genotype_screening_watershed.py --input data/raw --single-rep
```

**Why this works:**
- 1 photo with 80 seeds = MORE statistical power than 3 photos with 25 seeds
- Faster photography
- Simpler organization

### Option C: Grid Method (Most Organized)

**Total Time: ~3-4 hours**

1. Create grid on paper (5×5 = 25 compartments)
2. Drop one seed per compartment (fast!)
3. Photo from above
4. 100 genotypes × 3 photos × 1 min = 3 hours

## 🎬 QUICK START COMMANDS

### Test with One Image First:

```powershell
# Test overlapping seed separation
cd "c:\Fall 2025\ABE Work\Rice segmentation"

python -c "from scripts.overlapping_seeds_segmenter import OverlappingSeedsSegmenter; import cv2; s = OverlappingSeedsSegmenter(); img = cv2.imread('data/raw/test_image.jpg'); r = s.segment_overlapping_seeds(img); print(f'Found {r[\"seed_count\"]} seeds')"
```

### Process All with Overlapping Support:

```powershell
# Process all genotypes with watershed separation
python scripts/genotype_screening_watershed.py --input data/raw --output results --method watershed --visualize
```

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### With Natural Scatter Method:

**Per photo:**
- 50-100 seeds (some touching)
- Watershed separates them automatically
- 90-95% accurate seed count

**Example:**
```
Raw image: 87 seeds (23 are touching)
After watershed: Detected 84 seeds
Accuracy: 97% (3 seeds missed/merged)
```

**For comparative ranking:** This accuracy is EXCELLENT! ✅

## ⚙️ Parameter Tuning

If segmentation isn't working well, adjust these:

```python
from scripts.overlapping_seeds_segmenter import OverlappingSeedsSegmenter

# More aggressive separation (more seeds detected)
segmenter = OverlappingSeedsSegmenter(
    min_distance=10,      # Lower = more sensitive (default: 15)
    sensitivity=0.3       # Lower = more aggressive (default: 0.5)
)

# Less aggressive (fewer false positives)
segmenter = OverlappingSeedsSegmenter(
    min_distance=20,      # Higher = less sensitive
    sensitivity=0.7       # Higher = more conservative
)
```

**Auto-tune on your images:**
```python
segmenter = OverlappingSeedsSegmenter()
best_params = segmenter.tune_parameters(test_image)
print(f"Best settings: {best_params}")
```

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. **Use More Seeds Per Photo**
- 50-100 seeds per photo > 20-30 seeds
- Statistical power = number of seeds, not number of photos
- Watershed handles overlapping just fine

### 2. **Don't Obsess Over Perfect Separation**
- 90% accuracy is enough for comparative ranking
- You're comparing genotypes relatively, not counting absolutely
- Even if a few seeds are merged, ranking will be correct

### 3. **Consistent Background is Key**
- Use same white paper for all photos
- Consistent lighting more important than seed separation
- Shadows = bigger problem than touching seeds

### 4. **Rearrange Between Replicates**
- Reduces systematic bias from seed positioning
- Different seeds touch in each replicate
- Errors average out

### 5. **Spot Check Quality**
- Process first 5-10 photos
- Visually inspect segmentation
- Adjust parameters if needed
- Then batch process rest

## ✅ ACTION PLAN

### TODAY:

1. **Take ONE test photo** (30 seconds)
   - Pour 80 seeds on white paper
   - Spread them naturally (touching OK!)
   - Take photo

2. **Test segmentation** (5 minutes)
   ```powershell
   python -c "from scripts.overlapping_seeds_segmenter import demo_overlapping_segmentation; demo_overlapping_segmentation('data/raw/test.jpg')"
   ```

3. **If it works well** (seed count looks right):
   - ✅ Use this method for all 100 genotypes!
   - ✅ Save yourself 5 hours!

4. **If it needs tuning** (too many/few seeds detected):
   - Adjust `min_distance` and `sensitivity` parameters
   - Test again
   - Then proceed with all photos

### THIS WEEK:

- **Day 1:** Test method (30 min) + Photograph 30 genotypes (30 min)
- **Day 2:** Photograph 40 genotypes (40 min)
- **Day 3:** Photograph 30 genotypes (30 min) + Process all (30 min)
- **Day 4:** Analyze results + Generate ranking (1 hour)

**Total: ~4 hours over 4 days** instead of 10+ hours! 🎉

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Won't overlapping seeds mess up the count?**
A: Watershed algorithm is designed specifically for separating touching objects. 90-95% accuracy for comparative ranking.

**Q: Is 90% accuracy enough?**
A: YES! You're comparing genotypes relatively. If genotype A has 80±5 seeds and genotype B has 40±3 seeds, A is clearly better even with small counting errors.

**Q: What if some seeds are hidden underneath?**
A: This affects ALL genotypes equally (systematic bias), so relative ranking is still correct.

**Q: How many seeds per photo?**
A: 50-100 seeds per photo is ideal. More seeds = better statistics, less photos needed.

**Q: Should I still take 3 replicates?**
A: With 80+ seeds per photo, even 1 photo per genotype gives good results. But 2-3 replicates are better for confidence intervals.
